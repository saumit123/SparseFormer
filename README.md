## 📝 Project Description

Transformers have revolutionized natural language processing, but their core limitation lies in the **quadratic time and memory complexity** of the self-attention mechanism. This becomes a bottleneck when working with **long sequences** — especially on resource-constrained environments or in edge computing.

### ❌ Problem with Standard Transformers

Traditional Transformer models compute **full self-attention**, where each token attends to every other token in the sequence. While this is powerful, it leads to:

- **O(n²) time and space complexity**, where `n` is the sequence length
- High memory usage during training and inference
- Infeasibility for tasks involving long documents or time series

These issues make full Transformers impractical for many real-world applications where **efficiency matters more than brute-force accuracy**.

### ✅ Why This Sparse Transformer?

This project implements a **Simple Sparse Transformer** architecture in TensorFlow from scratch. It introduces a **sparse self-attention mechanism**, where each token only attends to a **fixed subset** of other tokens (e.g., local windows or strided patterns).

This design reduces the attention complexity from **O(n²)** to **O(n√n)** or even **O(n log n)** in some configurations — while still preserving most of the performance benefits of traditional Transformers.
